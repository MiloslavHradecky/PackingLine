"""
ðŸ“¦ Module: resources.py

Utility functions for resolving file paths in both development and bundled (.exe) environments.

Responsibilities:
- Locate resource files regardless of runtime context
- Resolve paths from config.ini (absolute or relative)
- Provide writable paths for logs and outputs
- Ensure consistent file access across platforms
